Played around with [trackingjs](https://github.com/eduardolundgren/tracking.js/) and [David Khourshid](https://github.com/davidkpiano)'s 
[Meshi the CSS Dog](https://codepen.io/davidkpiano/pen/kkpGWj).

Make sure to have enough light in your room (and worst-case scenario remove your glasses), otherwise your face can't be tracked.

## Get started

```bash
# install dependecies
$ npm install
```

Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Development

If you made changes to `style/main.scss` you will have to compile the latest sass file:

```bash
# compile sass file
$ npm run build-css
```
